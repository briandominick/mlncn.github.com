title: How I Became An Activore
---

 - Agaric background and knowing that starting a new company is the way to bigger and better things
 - bringing together Wes and Brian

Writing about the origin of Activore feels odd because while I cannot claim a scrap of credit for the initial idea, 



I have always wanted to help people gain the most power possible over our own lives.  I have also always believed that a for-profit isn't how to do it.

A self-coordinated movement of millions is harder to start than a business that helps people.

The first idea Wesley pitched us was an app to connect people who would make good workout partners.  We found that there are many who have tried to do something like this.  The best current effort is probably from our colleagues at <a href="http://tivity.us/">Tivity</a>.
